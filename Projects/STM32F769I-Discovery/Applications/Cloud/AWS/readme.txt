@par Application Description 


This application implements an Amazon AWS Cloud IoT client for the STM32F769I-Discovery board
using the on-board Ethernet interface driven by the LwIP TCP/IP stack,
and mbedTLS for secure network communication.

The application connects to Amazon AWS IoT Cloud with the credentials provided
by the user. When the User button is pushed, it sends a LED toggle command to the IoT Cloud
endpoint, which returns back the message to the board and trigs the LED toggle. 

Upon a double-push of the User button, the application exits.

@par Hardware and Software environment
  - STM32F769I-Discovery board.

  - Ethernet router.
      * With a transparent Internet connectivity: No proxy, no firewall blocking the outgoing trafic.
      * Running a DHCP server delivering the IP and DNS configuration to the board.

  - Amazon AWS account. Security keys and endpoint for AWS IoT 
    service must be created.

    see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-gs.html

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

 - WARNING: Before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.

 - Open the IAR IDE and compile the project (see the release note for detailed 
   information about the version). Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision 
   toolchain (see the release note for detailed information about the version). 
   Alternatively you can use the System Workbench for STM32 (see the release note 
   for detailed information about the version). 

 - Program the firmware on the STM32 board: If you generated a raw binary file, 
   you can copy (or drag and drop) it from Projects\STM32F769I-Discovery\Applications\Cloud\AWS\EWARM\STM32F769I-Discovery\Exe
   to the USB mass storage location created when you plug the STM32 
   board to your PC. If the host is a Linux PC, the STM32 device can be found in 
   the /media folder with the name e.g. "DIS_L4IOT". For example, if the created mass 
   storage location is "/media/DIS_L4IOT", then the command to program the board 
   with a binary file named "my_firmware.bin" is simply: cp my_firmware.bin 
   /media/DIS_L4IOT. 

   Alternatively, you can program the STM32 board directly through one of the 
   supported development toolchains, or thanks to the STM32 ST-Link Utility.
  
 - Configure the required settings (to be done only once): 
   - When the board is connected to a PC with USB (ST-LINK USB port), 
     open a serial terminal emulator, find the board's COM port and configure it with:
      - 8N1, 115200 bauds, no HW flow control
      - set the line endings to LF or CR-LF.

   - At first boot, enter the required parameters:

     - Enter the TLS network security keys needed for Amazon AWS connection (root CA key, 
       device certificate, private key).

       In order to use HTTPS for initializing the RTC, the root CA certificate of the target 
       server must be provided together (in the same copy-paste) with the Amazon root CA certificate.
       You can use the provided file: Verisign_Comodo_Plume.crt.
      
     - Enter the Amazon AWS IoT end-point (Amazon server address) and device ID.

   - After the parameters are configured, it is possible to change them by restarting the board 
     and pushing User button (blue button) when prompted during the initialization.

@par Connectivity test

  - By default the AWS project tries to automatically connect to Amazon AWS IoT cloud 
    (using the parameters set above). 

  - Push the User button (blue button) to publish the LED desired value. A message will be sent back
    by AWS IoT cloud and make the LED toggle.
